Simple linear regression is a model of regression which is used to identify the correlation between two variables and possibly predict the dependent variable by using the independent variable.This will enable us to establish a relationship between two attributes such as Income and Spending and we can use what we know about the relationship to forecast unobserved values.","banner":null},{"title":"Data Pre-Processing With R","tags":["machineLearning","dataScience","r"],"fullUrl":"https://rusith.me/blog/data-preprocessing-with-r","date":"Sat, May 4, 2019","description":"Before feeding our dataSet into a machine learning algorithm it's absolutely necessary to pre-process the data where we should clean and re-shape our data to get the maximum performance from our machine learning models. In this post, I will go through a set of procedures which you can use to pre-process a data set.","banner":null}],"tags":["programming","aws","web","machineLearning","react","javascript","dataScience","typescript","csharp","nextJS","ecs","cdk","devops","redux","testing","jest","dotnet","s3","nuget","bigdata","cloud","python","lambda","micro-service","genie","rdbms","angular"],"topTags":["programming","aws","web","machineLearning","react","javascript","dataScience","typescript","r","csharp"]},"__N_SSG":true}
