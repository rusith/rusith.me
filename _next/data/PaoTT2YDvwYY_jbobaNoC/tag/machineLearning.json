In simple linear regression, we had to use only one independent variable for the prediction. but in the real world often a dependent variable is dependent upon several variables.","banner":null},{"title":"Simple Linear Regression With R","tags":["machineLearning","dataScience","r"],"fullUrl":"https://rusith.me/blog/simple-linear-regression-with-r","date":"Tue, May 7, 2019","description":"Regression models are used to predict real values such as salary, spending, income. Simple linear regression is a model of regression which is used to identify the correlation between two variables and possibly predict the dependent variable by using the independent variable.This will enable us to establish a relationship between two attributes such as Income and Spending and we can use what we know about the relationship to forecast unobserved values.","banner":null},{"title":"The Essence of Machine Learning","tags":["machineLearning"],"fullUrl":"https://rusith.me/blog/the-essence-of-machine-learning","date":"Tue, May 7, 2019","description":"Machine learning can significantly improve the performance of a system. This could be very beneficial for businesses or any other application. So if someone comes to you and suggest you a business idea that involves machine learning, how do you decide that a machine learning implementation is feasible with the particular idea?","banner":null},{"title":"Data Pre-Processing With R","tags":["machineLearning","dataScience","r"],"fullUrl":"https://rusith.me/blog/data-preprocessing-with-r","date":"Sat, May 4, 2019","description":"Before feeding our dataSet into a machine learning algorithm it's absolutely necessary to pre-process the data where we should clean and re-shape our data to get the maximum performance from our machine learning models. In this post, I will go through a set of procedures which you can use to pre-process a data set.","banner":null}],"tags":["programming","aws","web","react","javascript","dataScience","typescript","r","csharp","nextJS","ecs","cdk","devops","redux","testing","jest","dotnet","s3","nuget","bigdata","cloud","python","lambda","micro-service","genie","rdbms","angular"],"topTags":["programming","aws","web","machineLearning","react","javascript","dataScience","typescript","r","csharp"]},"__N_SSG":true}
